I am currently an assistant professor at the School of Statistics and Management, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai, China. My research is mainly on statistics and econometrics, such as <mark>multivariate analysis</mark>, high-dimensional statistics, random matrix theory, and especially the applications in high-dimensional factor models with heavy-tailed data and matrix-variate data.
